      <h2>Shimizu Prize</h2>
      <div class="intro">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JCMC Award Committee has given the Shimizu Prize
        (Shimizu Prize for Recent Breakthrough in Monte Carlo Methods and
        Applications) to a distinguished young scientists who had made
        significant progress in Computational Materials Science field. The
        following two research fields are especially important, "Monte Carlo
        Methods in Electron Spectroscopy Analysis", and "Monte Carlo Methods in
        Computational Materials Science Computational Materials Science".
        Shimizu Prize winner is selected from each research field in turn every
        year. Shimizu Prize candidates are nominated by and fairly judged by the
        JCMC Award Committee consisting of neutral experts.

      <div class="intro">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further recognize the outstanding
        contributions of domestic scientists to computational science in the
        field of surface analysis and microbeam analysis, the Chinese Chapter of
        the Committee established the Ding Prize named by Prof. Ding Zejun. Li
        Yonggang of the Institute of Solid State Physics, Hefei Institute of
        Materials Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, was awarded the prize
        for his important role in the development of the international standard

      <h2>STAM young scientist award</h2>
      <div class="intro">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The STAM young scientist Awards are designed to
        encourage students to present their work. The award will be given to a
        limited number (around 3) of students. The STAM young scientist Award is
        automatically opened for all students registered. If you do not want it,
        please note it when you register at "Others" box. After all
        presentations, the committee will hold a vote around all invited
        speakers to decide the winners of STAM young scientist award. The
        program committee will announce the winners on the website prior to the
        symposium. Those winners will receive a certificate from Science and
        Technology of Advanced Materials (STAM) publishes and an APC free coupon
        in STAM journal or STAM method journal as a supplementary prize.
