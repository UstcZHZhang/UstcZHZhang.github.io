              Dr. Huimin Li has extended the Monte Carlo algorithm-based
              electron-material interaction model to complex geometries, making
              electron scattering simulations truly practical during his
              graduate course at the Laboratory for Microstructure of Solids,
              University of Science and Technology of China. His work on
              scanning electron microscopic imaging structural solids was one of
              the most important cornerstones for the development of the
              international standard “Microbeam analysis - Scanning electron
              microscopy - Method for evaluating critical dimensions by CD-SEM”

              >The fusion energy is the most promising way in the future due to
              the abundant fuel source and low contamination to the environment.
              The magnetic confined fusion is now the most possible way to
              realize the controlled fusion reaction and the tokamak is now
              considered as the best choice among the various magnetic confined
              devices. One of the most critical issue for the future fusion
              reactor is the huge heat load onto the divertor target, where the
              heating power in the main plasma is exhausted. While the
              traditional lower-single-null (LSN) divertor configuration is
              adopted in the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor as
              the heat exhaust solution, the ability may not sufficient for the
              future fusion reactor with higher fusion power. To explore the
              divertor solution for the critical heat exhaust issue, several
              advanced divertor configuration is proposed by introducing
              alternative magnetic configuration or optimizing the divertor
              geometry [1-2]. Based on the parameter of China Fusion Engineering
              Test Reactor, the snowflake divertor and long-legged divertor
              [3-5] is studied by numerical simulation using SOLPS (scrape-off
              layer plasma simulation) code. The effect on reducing the divertor
              heat load is confirmed in the simulations, and the detailed
              physical mechanism will be discussed in the conference. These
              works provides a useful reference for the physical design of the
              divertor in the future fusion reactor.</a

              >The parallel simulation technique of scanning electron microscope
              imaging based on Monte Carlo, electron tracking algorithm and
              geometric space construction is of great value in studying the
              properties of complex-shaped solids and semiconductor detection,
              which helps to improve the design of scanning electron microscope
              and understand the material material and structure corresponding
              to its imaging, and helps to improve the accuracy of semiconductor
              detection. Li Huimin started the numerical simulation of scanning
              electron microscope imaging with complex aggregate structure
              around 2003, and realized the massively parallelization, etc.,
              which laid the foundation for the related research afterwards.
              This paper reviews the background and history of this research and
              the subsequent expansion of semiconductor linewidth detection
              based on this research.</a
