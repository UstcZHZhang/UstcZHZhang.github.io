              >The Quantum Trajectory Monte Carlo (QTMC) method is an innovative
              computational technique that combines the principles of quantum
              mechanics, specifically through Bohmian mechanics for the
              trajectory analysis of particles, with the stochastic nature of
              Monte Carlo simulations. This synthesis allows for a nuanced
              exploration of electron behavior at atomic scales, particularly in
              the context of secondary electron generation and imaging.

              >In the future fusion reactor, tungsten (W) is considered as the
              preferred candidate of the plasma-facing material, due to its high
              conductivity, low sputtering yield as well as the low tritium
              retention. However, due to the high atomic number, the W could
              lead to significant radiation inside the core plasma, which means
              the concentration of W impurity in the core plasma has to be lower
              than ~10-5 [1]. In the present tokamak device, the divertor
              configuration is generally adopted, where the plasma leaving the
              confined region will flow towards the divertor targets in the
              so-called scrape-off layer (SOL) along the open magnetic field
              line. As a result, the region having intensive plasma-surface
              interaction can be placed in a certain distance from the confined
              region, which implies the contamination of the core plasma with
              the impurity sputtered from the plasma-facing surface is reduced.
              In the divertor configuration, the W sputtered from the divertor
              target will be ionized in the divertor region, then transport
              along the SOL and reach the core plasma by cross-field transport
              from the main SOL around the confined region. Considering the
              extreme low limit on the W concentration inside the core plasma,
              it is of great importance to understand the transport of W
              impurity in the SOL.
